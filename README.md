Objective:
The goal is to reduce the size of images while maintaining their quality, making storage and transmission more efficient.

Approach:
Our image compression method utilizes a combination of autoencoders and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively compress and reconstruct images.

Autoencoder
Architecture:

Encoder: The encoder part of the autoencoder compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional latent representation. This is achieved through several convolutional layers, which capture the essential features of the image while reducing its dimensionality.
Decoder: The decoder reconstructs the image from the compressed latent representation. It employs deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) layers to upsample the compressed data back to the original image dimensions.
Training:

The autoencoder is trained on a large dataset of images, where the objective is to minimize the reconstruction loss (typically Mean Squared Error) between the original image and the reconstructed image.
The training process involves optimizing the weights of the encoder and decoder through backpropagation.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Role in Compression:

Feature Extraction: CNNs are adept at extracting hierarchical features from images. The encoder part of the autoencoder leverages CNN layers to capture complex patterns and textures in the images.
Dimensionality Reduction: The CNN layers in the encoder reduce the spatial dimensions of the image, creating a compact representation that retains critical information.
Integration and Workflow
Input Image: The process starts with an input image that needs to be compressed.
Encoding: The image passes through the encoder, which uses CNN layers to compress it into a latent space representation. This representation is significantly smaller than the original image, reducing the storage requirements.
Latent Space: The compressed representation is a lower-dimensional vector that retains the essential features of the image.
Decoding: The decoder reconstructs the image from the latent space representation, attempting to restore it to its original quality.
Output Image: The final output is the reconstructed image, which, ideally, is visually similar to the original image but with reduced size.
